# Grocery-list
This is a code for a grocery list. 
When you open it, the file will ask you a question about what option you want to choose. 
Each option has a different function, for example, it can be to add an item to the list or mark an item as complete. 
You can also choose an option to leave the program, which would exit you from the grocery list.
